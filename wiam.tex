	The question in the title does not yet have a definite answer. One
	might even say that it is one of the most central, delicate, and
	difficult questions in arithmetic geometry. It is linked to important
	conjectures like the Hodge conjecture (Millenium problem), and
	Grothendieck's standard conjectures. In this talk I want to sketch what
	a motive *should* be, and what problems arise in some of the
	approaches.
