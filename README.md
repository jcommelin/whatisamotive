What is a motive?
=================

Notes for my 03032014 talk "What is a motive" @ RU PhD colloquium 
------------------------------------------------------------------

The question in the title does not yet have a definite answer. One might even
say that it is one of the most central, delicate, and difficult questions in
arithmetic geometry. It is linked to important conjectures like the Hodge
conjecture (Millenium problem), and Grothendieck's standard conjectures. In
this talk I want to sketch what a motive *should* be, and what problems arise
in some of the approaches.
